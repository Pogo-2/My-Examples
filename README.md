# some of my Projects 
I developed these code snippets in highschool and have since then moved onto bigger projects. Due to Company policies I am not allowed to reveal most of my current operating project. Because of this I hope to start adding my open source examples resembling projects that I have done since 2019. I am excited to recreate re-projects and share my experiences in this folder.

**a few things to expect:
- bash network hardware automation
- automating alerting system
- custom flask APIâ€™s 
- My Upperclassmen friends home work
- various custom exploitation tools used for CTF challenges.
- React apps
- and much more
