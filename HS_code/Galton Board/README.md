# Galton Board
## well what is it?
the Galton Board is a toy in some sorts where a series of pegs are lined up to create in a way to form a tringle. from the top a hopper feeds the system where the balls hit the top peg from here the balls have a 50/50 chance of going right or left. From here this proces continue untill the balls are collected in seperated chambers. now when this happens the balls form a perabula. This perabula is shown more and more clearly with the increasing number of balls or data.
## why did i make this?
well i made this to improve or even start my general programing skills
I consider this to be one of my first programs to launch my learning and development of programing in my free time.
This is by far one of my favorite programs but yet one of the smallest.
